## Security Showdown: 

"Security Showdown" is a blast from the past! It is a card game with 3 types of cards: Workload, Service and Action. Up to 4 players can play this and players need to be the first to complete 2 sets of secure workloads on AWS. Each workload card will not disclose the exact service cards needed to secure it, but will mention what security risks it needs mitigation against. For example, the 3-tier workload card will mention that (i) preventing DDoS attacks and (ii) preventing bot attacks are required, but will not disclose to the player that the required service cards to secure this workload would be (i) AWS Shield and (ii) AWS WAF respectively.
